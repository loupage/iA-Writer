Happy Thanksgiving. 

God has blessed us so often and in so many ways, that if we were to do as the old hymn says and count our blessings, it would require quite a few hours, days, and maybe even weeks, to even begin the list. But let’s start by thanking him for the wonderful salvation we have, through His son, Jesus Christ. Because of His death, we have life! 

This Sunday, I’ll be teaching on the work of the Holy Spirit. Scripture says that it is the work of the Holy Spirit to mature us. But to be honest, I’ve seen so many people who claim to be long-time followers of Jesus who don’t seem very mature. Why? Is the Holy Spirit letting them down? Perhaps there’s more to it than just logging time as a Christian. Maybe there are some things we must do to grow. And because we all want to grow spiritually, this is one important topic. So we will talk about such things on Sunday. 

See you Sunday, 

Pastor Kenny 

Don’t forget that we have moved to a one-service format on Sunday mornings and the service starts at 10:00.
