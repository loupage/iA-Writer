Hey Everyone,

Just a quick note to remind you that Char and I will be out of town Sunday. 

Pastor Ed will be filling in. I hope as many folks as possible will be present as Pastor Ed will have prepared a lesson and it is difficult if there are only one or two folks in attendance. 

Pray that Char and I will get some much needed R&R. 

Lou
